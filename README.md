Summary of the "Edit" Button Functionality in VacationList
In the Vacation Planner App, each vacation item in the VacationList features an "Edit" button that serves as a gateway to a multi-functional interface specifically tailored for that vacation. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what this button enables for each individual vacation:

Edit Vacation Details: Tapping the "Edit" button takes the user to the VacationDetails activity. Here, users can modify essential details of the vacation such as the title, hotel, start and end dates. This ensures that all vacation specifics are up-to-date and reflect the user's current plans.
View and Manage Associated Excursions: Upon entering the VacationDetails view via the "Edit" button, not only are the vacation details made editable, but the interface also displays all excursions that are linked to that vacation. This integrated view allows users to:
Edit Excursions: Each associated excursion can be individually edited to update details such as the title or date.
Delete Excursions: Users have the option to remove excursions that are no longer relevant or needed. This deletion is facilitated through a dialog confirmation to ensure intentional removal.
Set Alerts for the Vacation: From the same VacationDetails interface, users can set alerts for the start and end of the vacation. This feature ensures that users receive timely notifications that help them manage their vacation schedules effectively.
Share Vacation and Excursion Details: Additionally, the interface provides functionality to share comprehensive details of the vacation along with its associated excursions. This sharing is facilitated through common communication and social media platforms, allowing users to easily send detailed itineraries to friends, family, or colleagues.
Emphasized Functionalities
The "Edit" button is distinctly designed to offer a personalized and detailed management interface for each vacation listed in the VacationList. It uniquely links to the specific vacation it represents, ensuring that the user can not only edit the vacation itself but also:

Have a detailed overview of all its associated excursions,
Perform direct edits or deletions of these excursions from the same interface,
Set necessary alerts, and
Share all related information seamlessly.
